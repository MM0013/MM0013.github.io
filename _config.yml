description: "Hi, I’m Mammad. I am a Data Scientist and Reservoir Engineer with a background in system modeling, optimization, and emissions reduction, developed through over a decade of international experience. My portfolio features impactful projects where I applied Python, machine learning, and statistical analysis to streamline workflows, enhance operational efficiency, and support data-driven decision-making. For example, I built Python-based optimization models and Excel VBA tools to allocate lift gas among offshore wells, cutting test times by 26% and increasing daily revenue by $6600. I also developed simulation frameworks for CO₂ storage performance and conducted statistical analyses to optimize injection strategies. Feel free to explore my projects or connect with me using the links below!"
