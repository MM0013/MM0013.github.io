**Financial Q&A Engine for Investor Relations (Gen AI)** is a purpose-built assistant that enables internal teams and investors to interact with corporate financial documents using natural language. From earnings transcripts to shareholder letters and press releases, this system allows users to ask complex financial questions and receive accurate, context-grounded answers instantly. Built with GPT-4, LangChain, and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, the system streamlines investor communication and financial analysis.

# 1. Project Overview <a name="1-project-overview"></a>

Investor Relations (IR) teams often struggle to respond to shareholder questions quickly and accurately, especially when dealing with large volumes of financial documents. This project aims to simplify and streamline this process through the power of Generative AI.

This system empowers users to upload any financial documentation—including 10-K and 10-Q filings, earnings call transcripts, and investor presentations—and interact with the content using natural language. It uses GPT-4 with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to ensure answers are accurate, explainable, and grounded in real source material.

With a simple and intuitive interface, internal users or investors can ask questions like:
- "What did management say about capital expenditures last quarter?"
- "What was the guidance on revenue for the next fiscal year?"

The model searches the documents for relevant context, composes a coherent response, and returns it immediately, saving hours of manual searching.

# 2. Key Use Cases <a name="2-key-use-cases"></a>

### Investor Relations & Shareholder Communication
- Answer recurring questions on financial performance
- Share insights during or after earnings calls
- Ensure consistency across analyst and shareholder communications

### Executive Briefings
- CEOs, CFOs, and VPs can use the assistant to surface trends across reports
- Ask questions like: "What were the CEO’s strategic focus areas in the last 3 quarters?"

### Financial Analysts
- Analyze statements without reading 100+ pages of text
- Summarize net income performance, R&D allocation, or risk factors

# 3. Tools & Technologies Used <a name="3-tools--technologies-used"></a>

- **OpenAI GPT-4**: Large language model for summarization and response generation
- **LangChain**: Orchestration framework for document handling and retrieval chains
- **FAISS**: Facebook’s open-source vector similarity search engine for efficient indexing
- **OpenAIEmbeddings**: Converts text chunks into numerical vectors for similarity comparison
- **Streamlit**: Builds the interactive user interface
- **PyPDF2**: Parses PDF documents for ingestion
- **Python-dotenv**: Loads environment variables securely

---

# 4. Project Workflow <a name="4-project-workflow"></a>

1. **Upload financial documents**: PDF files such as earnings call transcripts, SEC filings, and investor presentations
2. **Extract and clean text**: Text is pulled from PDFs and structured linearly
3. **Chunking**: Large text is split into smaller overlapping chunks to preserve semantic integrity
4. **Embedding**: Each chunk is embedded using OpenAI’s embedding API into high-dimensional vectors
5. **Indexing**: FAISS stores embeddings in a searchable vector index
6. **Query**: User submits a natural language question from the UI
7. **Similarity Search**: The question is embedded and compared against the FAISS index to retrieve top-K relevant chunks
8. **Prompt Construction**: Retrieved context + user query is packaged into a prompt
9. **Response Generation**: GPT-4 generates an answer grounded in the retrieved context
10. **Display**: The result is returned in the Streamlit interface with relevant context (optional)

# 5. System Architecture <a name="5-system-architecture"></a>

The architecture below visualizes the full stack used to build the assistant:
```
User (PDF Upload & Question) → Streamlit App
                              ↓
                    Text Extraction (PyPDF2)
                              ↓
         Text Chunking + Embeddings (LangChain + OpenAI)
                              ↓
                 Vector Search Index (FAISS)
                              ↓
      Retrieved Chunks + Question → LLM (GPT-4 via LangChain RetrievalQA)
                              ↓
                Final Answer Displayed on UI
```

### Components:
- **Document Loader**: Accepts and processes multiple document formats
- **Preprocessing Pipeline**: Cleans, chunks, and embeds data
- **Vector Index (FAISS)**: Enables fast document search
- **Retriever Module**: Finds top-matching documents for user query
- **LLM Module (GPT-4)**: Generates natural language responses with cited evidence
- **Front-end**: Web-based UI for uploading documents and asking questions
