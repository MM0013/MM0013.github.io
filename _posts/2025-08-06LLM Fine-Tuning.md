**LLM Fine-Tuning Blueprint Project** is a structured two-part guide for building reliable, fine-tuned large language models. It integrates **strategic decision-making** with a practical **execution playbook**, helping AI builders move from theory to production-ready models. Inspired by Shivani Virdi’s work, this portfolio project outlines the **when, why, and how** of fine-tuning LLMs.

# 1. Project Overview <a name="1-project-overview"></a>

Fine-tuning is the process of updating an LLM’s **internal weights** with new data, teaching it domain-specific structure, tone, and reasoning. Unlike prompting or retrieval, fine-tuning **rewrites behavior at the model level**.  

This project summarizes **best pract**
